clectric designs and builds synth modules for the AE Modular format and its growing SynthDIY community. Our mission is to make modular synths more accessible, playful, and personalâ€”whether you're just starting out or building your own custom system.

We sell our own modules, but we're more excited about our work at [clectric.diy](https://clectric.diy) where we focus on open-source projects that blend digital and analog sound-making, including modules based on the Electrosmith Daisy Seed platform. Everything we create in that community is designed to be hackable, affordable, and fun to explore.
