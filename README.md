clectric designs and builds synth modules for the AE Modular format and the growing SynthDIY community. Our mission is to make modular synths more accessible, playful, and personal—whether you're just starting out or building your own custom system.

We sell our own modules too, but we're more excited about our work on open-source projects that blend digital and analog sound-making, including modules for the AE Modular format and firmware based on the Electrosmith Daisy platform. Everything we create is designed to be hackable, affordable, and fun to explore.

clectric.diy is a space for experimentation, learning, and sharing—with a growing library of notes, prototypes, and ideas always in progress. We’re here to help you build the sounds you imagine.
